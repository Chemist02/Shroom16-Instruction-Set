# Shroom16 Instruction Set
This is a work in progress assembler and virtual machine software package that implements the Shroom16 Instruction Set (an original dialect of assembly). It's intended to be used with the Shiitake-16: a fully programmable redstone computer built enteirely in vanilla Minecraft! While the project is likely months from completetion, I though it might be fun to release the code base thus far.

## Planned Features
* Fully programmable redstone computer complete with 16 bit registers, an ALU (including multiplcation and division instructions), a kilobyte of data memory, graphics, and an I/O system.
* A custom dialect of assembly that can be written in regular text files using your text editor of choice. These can then be assembled into machine code that can be run on the in game computer using the shroomasm software (one of the programs in this package), or on the virtual machine shroomvm (again, in this package). In other words, it compiles source code into Minecraft blocks!
* Exensive documentation, although this is not publically available yet.
